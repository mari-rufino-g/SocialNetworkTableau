# ðŸŽª Social Network Analysis: Reimagining "A Flor da Idade" as a Brazilian Square Dance

## ðŸ“– About the Project

Taking advantage of the festive atmosphere of Brazilian June festivals (Festa Junina), this creative project reimagines Chico Buarque's iconic song "A Flor da Idade" as a traditional Brazilian square dance (quadrilha), exploring social connections through social network analysis (graph).

While the original song is a poetic reflection on youth and young love, I used its essence as inspiration to create a narrative of intertwined relationships at a fictional June festival. Using graph analysis techniques, I transformed these imaginary relationships into an interactive visualization that reveals patterns of social connectivity.

## ðŸŽµ The Original Song

"A Flor da Idade" is a composition by Chico Buarque that speaks about youth - seen as the most beautiful and intense moment of life. The song portrays the experience of young love, with all its strength, hope, and anxieties, bringing a nostalgic reflection on this special and transformative period of life. For this project, I poetically reinterpreted this theme of emotional connections as a network of relationships at a June festival.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Python** - Main language for data processing
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and structuring into DataFrames
- **NetworkX** - Library for creating and analyzing complex networks
- **Tableau** - Final interactive graph visualization

## ðŸš€ Methodology

1. **Creative Concept**: Reinterpretation of "A Flor da Idade" theme (youth and love) as a fictional Brazilian square dance
2. **Character Creation**: Development of characters inspired by the song's universe and June festival culture
3. **Data Structuring**: Creation of a DataFrame with nodes (characters) and edges (relationships)
4. **Network Modeling**: Using NetworkX to build the graph and calculate network metrics
5. **Visualization**: Data export to Tableau for creating an interactive and aesthetically appealing visualization

## ðŸ“Š Results

The project revealed interesting insights about the social structure of the fictional square dance:
- Identification of central characters in the relationship network
- Connectivity patterns among festival participants
- Clear visualization of emotional and social connections
- Visual representation of the complexity of young relationships

## ðŸŽ¨ Visualization

The final Tableau visualization presents:
- Nodes representing each character in the square dance
- Edges showing connections/relationships
- Optimized layout to highlight network structure
- Thematic design inspired by Brazilian June festivals

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates how network analysis can be applied creatively, combining musical inspiration with data visualization. It was a unique opportunity to connect Chico Buarque's poetry with modern data science techniques, transforming art into visual insights. Additionally, it was an opportunity to practice:

- Creative thinking applied to data science
- Fictional social network modeling
- Integration between Python and visualization tools
- Connection between Brazilian culture and data analysis
- Storytelling through visualizations
